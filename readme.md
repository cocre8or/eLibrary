## About eLibrary
eLibrary is currently Rayshawn Eatmon's hobby application. The eLibrary Project has virtual Login, Checkout, and Checking functionality, so you're not actually checking out real books. This functionality can be done via Postman and a client application or more. The tech used is Mongo DB, Python and Flask, and an attached Postman collection. 

To get started you'll need to install Mongo DB and Postman on your local machine. The current connection string configuration for this project is "mongodb://localhost:27017/".
Once mongo db is installed, you can start the main.py file by typing the following in your command line or terminal:

```
<Cloned repo dir>/eLibrary> python .\main.py
```

Next, import the postman collection from this project. Then you will have the means to Create Users, Get user information, Checkout books, CheckIn books and the ability to re-login when your session has expired.
